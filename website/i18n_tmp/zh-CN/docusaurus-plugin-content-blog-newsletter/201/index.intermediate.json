Unlike other module solutions, it is able to bridge directly to Swift and Kotlin (from C++). A simple benchmark shows that Nitro Modules outperform ExpoModules and TurboModules on a simple operation. So far the community feedback from early adopters has been very positive, notably William Candillion using it on react-native-wgpu.
