Perhaps that's a welcome change, especially after the whirlwind of events like Expo 50, visionOS, the State of React Native, react-strict-dom, and more. However, this doesn't mean the React Native world has come to a halt. There‚Äôs been a lot of little announcements that give us a glimpse in the near future of React Native. The first release candidates for [RN 0.74](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ee2bc59dfe4579cad3b7f0b5de667a89fcac8710/CHANGELOG.md#0740-rc0) were released. They contain a lot of improvements as well as some deprecations and breaking changes, but from the first glance nothing major that makes me worried about upgrading effort. Most notably, bridgeless mode becomes the new default with 0.74 (but only when New Arch is enabled). Bridgeless mode is the third pillar of the New Arch, after the already introduced TurboModules and new renderer (Fabric). Speaking of New Arch and defaults, a [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/43135) was merged that‚Äôll make the New Arch the default beginning with RN 0.75 (it will still be possible to opt out though). Also, the RFC with the [React Native Frameworks](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md) definition has been merged, laying out the responsibilities of RN vs frameworks on top of RN.",
