Reflecting this shift, the `/template` folder has been removed from the core `react-native` package, and the `react-native init` command is set to be deprecated by the end of 2024, though both will still be accessible within the `@react-native-community` packages. Notably, this update brings significant improvements, including [enhanced performance during the auto-linking build phase](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/814) and the addition of [Yoga 3.1](https://www.yogalayout.dev/blog/announcing-yoga-3.1), which now supports the use of percentages for `gap`, `columnGap`, `rowGap`, and `translation` props when the new architecture is enabled. With these advancements, it's clear that adopting the new architecture is crucial for staying up to date with the latest features and stability improvements.",
