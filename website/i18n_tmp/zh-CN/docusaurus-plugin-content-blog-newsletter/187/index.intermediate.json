This surprised me, I couldn’t guess such React code would leak memory, and pretty sure my apps contain memory leaks now 😅. Good news though: the app wouldn't leak memory when using the new React Compiler.\n* 📜 [Automatic Query Invalidation after Mutations](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/automatic-query-invalidation-after-mutations): React Query is un-opinionated about how you invalidate cached resources and instead lets you implement a custom strategy on top of flexible primitives. For example, you can invalidate queries by tags.\n* 📜 [Migrating from Radix to React Aria: Improving Accessibility and UX](https://argos-ci.com/blog/react-aria-migration): After having used alternatives such as Reakit or Radix, Greg gives good reasons for adopting React Aria. The migration feedback is positive, but some challenges were encountered. React Aria is quite “strict” at ensuring your components remain accessible.\n* 📜 [On Laravel, Full-Stack JavaScript, and Productive Frameworks](https://www.jplhomer.org/posts/on-laravel-full-stack-javascript-and-productive-frameworks/): Josh created 2 React meta-frameworks (including Shopify Hydrogen) and also uses Laravel extensively.

Server Actions run serially, and you need to wait for RSCs to re-render which might be slow without proper caching. Using React-Query with prefetching might slightly increase bundle size and produce more roundtrips, but overall that could give a faster UX.\n* 📜 [Using Server Actions with tRPC](https://trpc.io/blog/trpc-actions): Server Actions are similar to tRPC but come barebone. tRPC maintainer explains things that tRPC enables on top, such as auth, input validation, observability, rate-limiting, and other possible middleware.

For example, you can invalidate queries by tags.\n- 📜 [Migrating from Radix to React Aria: Improving Accessibility and UX](https://argos-ci.com/blog/react-aria-migration): After having used alternatives such as Reakit or Radix, Greg gives good reasons for adopting React Aria. The migration feedback is positive, but some challenges were encountered. React Aria is quite “strict” at ensuring your components remain accessible.\n- 📜 [On Laravel, Full-Stack JavaScript, and Productive Frameworks](https://www.jplhomer.org/posts/on-laravel-full-stack-javascript-and-productive-frameworks/): Josh created 2 React meta-frameworks (including Shopify Hydrogen) and also uses Laravel extensively. He shares an interesting perspective on the pros/cons of the Laravel vs React ecosystem.\n- 📜 [A virtual DOM in 200 lines of JavaScript](https://lazamar.github.io/virtual-dom/): This greatly explains how a virtual DOM (like the one from React) works under the hood, by creating a small library that can run a TodoMVC app.\n- 📜 [Design System Retrospective](https://kyleshevlin.com/design-system-retrospective/): Interesting perspective on the successfulness of implementing a Chakra-like design system (tokens as props). The average dev struggled to understand how to compose primitives. Tailwind might be a better fit for them.\n- 📜 [Combining React Server Components with react-query for Easy Data Management](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/combining-react-server-components-with-react-query-for-easy-data-management/): A good read explaining limits RSCs. Server Actions run serially, and you need to wait for RSCs to re-render which might be slow without proper caching. Using React-Query with prefetching might slightly increase bundle size and produce more roundtrips, but overall that could give a faster UX.\n- 📜 [Using Server Actions with tRPC](https://trpc.io/blog/trpc-actions): Server Actions are similar to tRPC but come barebone. tRPC maintainer explains things that tRPC enables on top, such as auth, input validation, observability, rate-limiting, and other possible middleware. Note there are alternatives to consider such as next-server-action and zsa.\n- 📜 [Optimizing INP for a React App & Performance Learnings](https://www.iamtk.co/optimizing-inp-for-a-react-app-and-performance-learnings): A long feedback on optimizing responsiveness on a React 18 prod app. Various takeaways include deferring work and analytics, or being careful of useless re-renders.\n- 📜 [Partial Prerendering without a framework](https://developers.netlify.com/guides/partial-prerendering-without-a-framework/): Demo from Netlify CEO shows how to implement “vanilla PPR” (without Next.js which has this as an experimental feature).\n- 📜 [Behind the ‘as’ prop: polymorphism done well](https://www.kripod.dev/blog/behind-the-as-prop-polymorphism-done-well/): Also explains how to type it properly.\n- 📜 [Redwood - Using Middleware: RSS and Sitemap](https://redwoodjs.com/blog/using-middleware-rss-and-sitemap)\n- 📜 [Structured logging for Next.js - Using the Pino logging library](https://blog.arcjet.com/structured-logging-in-json-for-next-js/)\n- 📜 [Facebook just updated its relationship status with web components](https://www.mux.com/blog/facebook-just-updated-it-s-relationship-status-with-web-components)\n- 📜 [Authentication with WorkOS in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.nirtamir.com/articles/authentication-with-workos-in-next-js-a-comprehensive-guide)\n- 📜 [The Next.js \\<Image> Component](https://www.premieroctet.com/blog/en/next-image-component)\n- 📜 [How To Dockerize A React App](https://scientyficworld.org/how-to-dockerize-a-react-app/)\n- 📦 [Astro 4.9 - React 19 support for Astro Actions](https://astro.build/blog/astro-490/): Adds new withState/getActionState APIs to integrate Astro with React 19 useActionState, including progressive enhancement.\n- 📦 [Storybook 8.1 - typesafe mocking, Unit testing React Server Components](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8-1/)\n- 📦 [NextUI 2.4](https://nextui.org/blog/v2.4.0)\n- 📦 [Ark UI 3.0](https://ark-ui.com/react/docs/overview/changelog#300---2024-05-24)\n- 📦 [React-Query 5.39 - Supports React 19](https://github.com/TanStack/query/releases/tag/v5.39.0)\n- 📦 [Redwood 7.6 - React Compiler experimental flag](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/releases/tag/v7.6.0)\n- 📦 [zsa 0.1 - Typesafe Server Actions for Next.js](http://next.js)\n- 📦 [React-Executor - Asynchronous task execution and state management for React](https://github.com/smikhalevski/react-executor)\n- 🎥 [UI Engineering - Portals Can Share State Between Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZx33FPMXzc): It's a pretty cool idea to use React portals to integrate seamlessly between windows and might also be useful for the upcoming browser Picture-in-Picture API.\n- 🎥 [Theo - I Was Wrong About React Router.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m86HssTKExU)\n- 🎥 [James Quick - Astro Launches Actions Similar like Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mIUIhp2YGQ)",
