While still under development, Static Hermes offers a novel approach by compiling JavaScript into native machine code or typed bytecode through type annotation analysis, with the potential for C++-level performance. However, this workflow has its limitations: over-the-air (OTA) updates will no longer function, current JavaScript build tools like Babel do not retain type annotations, and there is still a considerable amount of untyped code in use.

      "sourceMdx": "- 🎥 [Tzvetan Mikov - Hermes: Better performance with runtime bytecode translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfeTPSai6vc&t=8702s)  \n  Static Hermes, introduced at React Native Europe last year, has sparked significant interest by challenging existing JavaScript engine standards. While still under development, Static Hermes offers a novel approach by compiling JavaScript into native machine code or typed bytecode through type annotation analysis, with the potential for C++-level performance. However, this workflow has its limitations: over-the-air (OTA) updates will no longer function, current JavaScript build tools like Babel do not retain type annotations, and there is still a considerable amount of untyped code in use.
