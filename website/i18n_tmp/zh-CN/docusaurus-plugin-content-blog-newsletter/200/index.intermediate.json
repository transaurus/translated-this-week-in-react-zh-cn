While still under development, Static Hermes offers a novel approach by compiling JavaScript into native machine code or typed bytecode through type annotation analysis, with the potential for C++-level performance. However, this workflow has its limitations: over-the-air (OTA) updates will no longer function, current JavaScript build tools like Babel do not retain type annotations, and there is still a considerable amount of untyped code in use. To address these challenges, the Hermes team has introduced runtime bytecode translation, which promises performance boosts of up to 12 times faster for native compilation. These innovations will be available in Hermes v2, once they have undergone extensive internal testing at Meta.",
