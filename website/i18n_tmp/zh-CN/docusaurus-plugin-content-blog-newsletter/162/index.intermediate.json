William Candillon had already 🎥 [explained this problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D78Tc46Xqo\\&t=1156s) in 2021, with the possibility of optimising Text rendering. It is possible to optimize as long as you don't need a few features like `onPress` listeners. This article presents a benchmark and measures the impact of using the native components instead of regular components, and reports a gain of around 15%, with variations depending on the platform and architecture.",
      "sourceMdx": "At the moment, React-Native devs are talking a lot [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1707762822015267219) about the perf of the `Text` and `View` components, which are JS wrappers and add overhead compared to the respective native `RCTText` and `RCTView` elements. William Candillon had already 🎥 [explained this problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D78Tc46Xqo&t=1156s) in 2021, with the possibility of optimising Text rendering.
