The changelog pagination example is cool and shows that even libraries like React Query might become less useful.\n* 📜 [Introducing Pigment CSS: the next generation of CSS-in-JS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/): the MUI team explains the motivations to create their own in-house CSS-in-JS solution, built on top of the WyW-in-JS toolkit, that should power MUI v6 later this year. It is compatible with RSCs. The adoption for MUI/Emotion/StyledComponent users should be easy.\n* 📜 [Digging for SSRF in NextJS apps](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/digging-for-ssrf-in-nextjs-apps): Security researchers explain blind Server Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities they found in Next.js related to the Image component and Server Actions implementations. Those vulnerabilities have been patched since Next.js 14.1.1 already (January 2024).\n* 📜 [Prefer Multiple Compositions](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-multiple-compositions/): If your component has a finite set of cases to handle, it will be more maintainable to have clear separate if/else branches for each cases rather than spreading conditionals everywhere in JSX.\n* 📜 [Prefer Noun-Adjective Naming](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-noun-adjective-naming/): I also prefer to name a component “ButtonPrimary” instead of “PrimaryButton”. Related things remain grouped alphabetically, and are easier to lookup in the IDE.\n* 📜 [Inline Styles on Steroids](https://weser.io/blog/inline-styles-on-steroids): With projects such as CSS Hooks, and the web platform planning to add support for inline style nesting, it’s only a matter of time until inline styles make a huge comeback. The author of Fela recreates the DX of a good CSS-in-JS library on top of CSS Hooks thanks to 2 new projects he’s working on.\n* 📜 [Quantifying the Impact of Styled Components on Server Response Times](https://blog.levineandrew.com/quantifying-the-impact-of-styled-components-on-server-response-times): Uses SpeedScope (more powerful than Chrome DevTools) to analyze a CPU trace and concludes that style injection takes 47% of SSR time.\n* 📜 [Storybook - Portable stories for Playwright Component Tests](https://storybook.js.org/blog/portable-stories-for-playwright-ct/): Although Storybook provides a play() function using a Playwright test runner, you might still want to use Playwright Component testing directly, and reuse your existing stories there.\n* 📜 [Deploying Remix to Cloudflare with SST](https://ruanmartinelli.com/blog/remix-sst-cloudflare): Using SST to deploy your app to a major cloud can be a nice alternative to DX platforms like Vercel/Netlify. TIL that it’s so simple to use, and it also supports deploying to Cloudflare.\n* 📦 [Restyle](https://reactstyle.vercel.app/): New CSS-in-JS library compatible with RSC that’s leveraging the brand-new style hoisting and deduplication feature of React 19. Those new React primitives were also designed with CSS-in-JS libs in mind, and it’s great to see the community already leveraging them. It’s also interesting for distributing CSS as part of a React library npm package.\n* 📦 [React Google Maps 1.0](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/google-maps-platform-graduates-react-integration-library-to-1-0/): The official Google Maps library for React is now stable, maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.\n* 📦 [Million Lint 1.0-rc](https://million.dev/blog/lint-rc): IDE extension that automatically finds and fixes performance issues for you. Unlike the React compiler, it is based on runtime analysis and can detect additional performance problems that the compiler can’t. Both can be used in tandem.\n* 📦 [Zustand 5.0-beta - Upgrade guide available - drop deprecated features, upgrades React/TS](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/v5/docs/guides/migrating-to-v5.mdx)\n* 📦 [Storybook 8.1 - tag filtering, typesafe mocking, beforeEach, portable stories API](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases/tag/v8.1.0)\n* 📦 [Storybook-Rsbuild - Storybook builder powered by Rsbuild](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild)",

The changelog pagination example is cool and shows that even libraries like React Query might become less useful.\n- 📜 [Introducing Pigment CSS: the next generation of CSS-in-JS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/): the MUI team explains the motivations to create their own in-house CSS-in-JS solution, built on top of the WyW-in-JS toolkit, that should power MUI v6 later this year. It is compatible with RSCs. The adoption for MUI/Emotion/StyledComponent users should be easy.\n- 📜 [Digging for SSRF in NextJS apps](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/digging-for-ssrf-in-nextjs-apps): Security researchers explain blind Server Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities they found in Next.js related to the Image component and Server Actions implementations. Those vulnerabilities have been patched since Next.js 14.1.1 already (January 2024).\n- 📜 [Prefer Multiple Compositions](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-multiple-compositions/): If your component has a finite set of cases to handle, it will be more maintainable to have clear separate if/else branches for each cases rather than spreading conditionals everywhere in JSX.\n- 📜 [Prefer Noun-Adjective Naming](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-noun-adjective-naming/): I also prefer to name a component “ButtonPrimary” instead of “PrimaryButton”. Related things remain grouped alphabetically, and are easier to lookup in the IDE.\n- 📜 [Inline Styles on Steroids](https://weser.io/blog/inline-styles-on-steroids): With projects such as CSS Hooks, and the web platform planning to add support for inline style nesting, it’s only a matter of time until inline styles make a huge comeback. The author of Fela recreates the DX of a good CSS-in-JS library on top of CSS Hooks thanks to 2 new projects he’s working on.\n- 📜 [Quantifying the Impact of Styled Components on Server Response Times](https://blog.levineandrew.com/quantifying-the-impact-of-styled-components-on-server-response-times): Uses SpeedScope (more powerful than Chrome DevTools) to analyze a CPU trace and concludes that style injection takes 47% of SSR time.\n- 📜 [Storybook - Portable stories for Playwright Component Tests](https://storybook.js.org/blog/portable-stories-for-playwright-ct/): Although Storybook provides a play() function using a Playwright test runner, you might still want to use Playwright Component testing directly, and reuse your existing stories there.\n- 📜 [Deploying Remix to Cloudflare with SST](https://ruanmartinelli.com/blog/remix-sst-cloudflare): Using SST to deploy your app to a major cloud can be a nice alternative to DX platforms like Vercel/Netlify. TIL that it’s so simple to use, and it also supports deploying to Cloudflare.\n- 📦 [Restyle](https://reactstyle.vercel.app/): New CSS-in-JS library compatible with RSC that’s leveraging the brand-new style hoisting and deduplication feature of React 19. Those new React primitives were also designed with CSS-in-JS libs in mind, and it’s great to see the community already leveraging them. It’s also interesting for distributing CSS as part of a React library npm package.\n- 📦 [React Google Maps 1.0](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/google-maps-platform-graduates-react-integration-library-to-1-0/): The official Google Maps library for React is now stable, maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.\n- 📦 [Million Lint 1.0-rc](https://million.dev/blog/lint-rc): IDE extension that automatically finds and fixes performance issues for you. Unlike the React compiler, it is based on runtime analysis and can detect additional performance problems that the compiler can’t. Both can be used in tandem.\n- 📦 [Zustand 5.0-beta - Upgrade guide available - drop deprecated features, upgrades React/TS](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/v5/docs/guides/migrating-to-v5.mdx)\n- 📦 [Storybook 8.1 - tag filtering, typesafe mocking, beforeEach, portable stories API](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases/tag/v8.1.0)\n- 📦 [Storybook-Rsbuild - Storybook builder powered by Rsbuild](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild)"
