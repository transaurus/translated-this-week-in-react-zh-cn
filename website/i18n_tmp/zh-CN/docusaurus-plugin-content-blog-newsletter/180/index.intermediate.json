And although you can still turn it off, the message is clear: It’s time to start adopting the New Architecture. There has been a lot of effort to prepare the RN ecosystem for the New Arch, and now there’s a great spreadsheet tracking New Architecture and Bridgeless Mode support for many popular RN libraries. As you can see in the screenshot above, there’s lots of green already, although plenty of rows require some more work as well. In my opinion, even beyond the pure question of which libraries already support the new paradigms this list is also very interesting if you only want to check out which RN libraries are the most popular ones or which technical challenges library authors face when shifting to the New Arch.",
      "sourceMdx": "This week's headline news is … a spreadsheet? Yes, indeed. We’re approaching the release of React Native 0.74, which will have the Interop Layer and Bridgeless Mode enabled by default. And although you can still turn it off, the message is clear: It’s time to start adopting the New Architecture. There has been a lot of effort to prepare the RN ecosystem for the New Arch, and now there’s a great spreadsheet tracking New Architecture and Bridgeless Mode support for many popular RN libraries. As you can see in the screenshot above, there’s lots of green already, although plenty of rows require some more work as well. In my opinion, even beyond the pure question of which libraries already support the new paradigms this list is also very interesting if you only want to check out which RN libraries are the most popular ones or which technical challenges library authors face when shifting to the New Arch."
