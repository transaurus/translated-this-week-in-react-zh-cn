A new React Router feature enables you to split your route manifest in chunks. This article explains how it has been integrated in Remix 2.10 and what are the tradeoffs. It turns out a route manifest can grow quite large, and if you don’t split it, it might delay your app’s React hydration because it has to be downloaded upfront. If you have a medium/large Remix or React Router site, I’d recommend to check the size your route manifest immediately, and think about logical ways to split it, because the size reduction this new feature enable can have a significant perf impact. Shopify’s initial manifest went from 10MB to 1.9KB! The Docusaurus website manifest is also 200KB and I definitively plan to implement this.",
