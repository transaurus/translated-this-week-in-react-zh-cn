Part 1 (of 3) is available and describes how to implement the Server Components side.\n* 📖 [Next.js Docs Update - Project Organization page](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1662211824211877889)\n* 📜 [Is React Having An Angular.js Moment?](https://marmelab.com/blog/2023/06/05/react-angularjs-moment.html): does the arrival of Server Components represent a paradigm shift similar to Angular.js vs Angular 2? No, because Server Components are an optional new feature and the rest of React continues to work as before. This article does warn, however, that it may be a little early to recommend and adopt RSCs, and the ecosystem isn't fully ready.\n* 📜 [Opinionated notes on React Server components](https://github.com/nilshartmann/react-server-component-material/blob/notes-on-rsc/notes-on-rsc.md): set of notes and reflections on RSCs.

No, because Server Components are an optional new feature and the rest of React continues to work as before. This article does warn, however, that it may be a little early to recommend and adopt RSCs, and the ecosystem isn't fully ready.\n- 📜 [Opinionated notes on React Server components](https://github.com/nilshartmann/react-server-component-material/blob/notes-on-rsc/notes-on-rsc.md): set of notes and reflections on RSCs.
