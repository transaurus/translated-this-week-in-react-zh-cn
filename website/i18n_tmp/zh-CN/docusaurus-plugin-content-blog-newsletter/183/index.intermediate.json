At the same time, development teams are often struggling to adapt workload to the limited subset of APIs available on the edge runtime. Now it seams Vercel has come to the conclusion that overall, the challenges for developers outweigh the limited benefits, and is therefore reverting to centralized Node.js runtimes.
