On the one hand, edge means that compute is run near to where a user accessing a site hosted on Vercel is located. On the other hand, it also means that this compute is run on an “edge runtime,” which is built on V8 and not on Node.js. While the concept of running compute near to the end users sound appealing, the advantages quickly disappear if data needs to be loaded from a central location (which very often is the case). At the same time, development teams are often struggling to adapt workload to the limited subset of APIs available on the edge runtime. Now it seams Vercel has come to the conclusion that overall, the challenges for developers outweigh the limited benefits, and is therefore reverting to centralized Node.js runtimes. I appreciate their transparency around this! If you want more details, Theo made a [video](https://youtu.be/lAGE-k1Zfrg?si=5SP4hyoFkixTsh-y) about it.",
