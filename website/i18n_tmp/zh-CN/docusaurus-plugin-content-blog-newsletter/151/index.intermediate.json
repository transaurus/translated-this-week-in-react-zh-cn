The article is fairly technical, explaining how it works internally to run at 60+ FPS. TLDR: it's now very easy to integrate a TensorFlow model into Vision Camera, and draw some real-time feedback via React-Native-Skia. There's no need to write native code, and all this logic can even be deployed via Over-The-Air updates!",
