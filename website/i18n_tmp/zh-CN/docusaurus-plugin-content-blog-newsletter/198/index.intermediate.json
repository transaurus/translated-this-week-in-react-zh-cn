Unfortunately, there is no real solution.\n- 📜 [Multipart Namespace Components: Addressing RSC and Dot Notation Issues](https://ivicabatinic.from.hr/posts/multipart-namespace-components-addressing-rsc-and-dot-notation-issues): Explains how components like `<Card.Body>` can cause troubles in the RSC world and prevent tree-shaking. Suggests using named ES exports instead of assigning properties to the default root component.

IMHO you can also use React context.\n- 📜 [Consuming a Remix backend from a mobile app or external client](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-external-client): The `?_data` workaround will not work anymore under Remix Single Fetch mode. You’d rather create dedicated API routes for mobile apps and share common code in an abstraction.\n- 📜 [Why is CSS-in-JS slow?](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/why-is-css-in-js-slow): Greatly illustrated articles explain why traditional CSS-in-JS is slow, and how compiled CSS-in-JS makes it faster by avoiding a waterfall chain of steps for the browsers.\n- 📜 [Interface Segregation Principle in React](https://alexkondov.com/interface-segregation-principle-in-react/): Explains how to apply this SOLID principle when designing component props and encourages you to use composition.

That’s why I’m [migrating Docusaurus to Rspack](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1828696665135431879) by the way. I’d also recommend to take a look at [Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.dev/), it’s a great tool that also works with Webpack and will tell you the bottlenecks of your build.",
