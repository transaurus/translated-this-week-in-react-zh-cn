Andrew has a working implementation to add support for pre-rendering siblings in Suspense components, and this is the first of a series of PR.

This mitigates a security risk reported by the community and avoids exposing endpoints by mistake.\n- 👀 [React DevTools PR - Support Server Components in Tree](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30684): Also adds a `[server]` badge.\n- 👀 [React Router PR - Add support for `routes.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11773): Defines a static list of routes, with a possibility to plug in the Remix filesystem convention.

Unfortunately, there is no real solution.\n- 📜 [Multipart Namespace Components: Addressing RSC and Dot Notation Issues](https://ivicabatinic.from.hr/posts/multipart-namespace-components-addressing-rsc-and-dot-notation-issues): Explains how components like `<Card.Body>` can cause troubles in the RSC world and prevent tree-shaking. Suggests using named ES exports instead of assigning properties to the default root component. Libs like Chakra and Radix do that.\n- 📜 [Implementing React from scratch](https://www.rob.directory/blog/react-from-scratch): Reimplements typing, reconciliation, and hooks. You might discover surprising things along the way, such as the ability to call `useContext` conditionally, or the fact that `useCallback` is similar to `useMemo` returning a callback.\n- 📜 [An SSR Performance Showdown](https://blog.platformatic.dev/an-ssr-performance-showdown): You might have seen this benchmark showing React SSR as being slow. It should be updated with more accurate numbers soon. [Dan Abramov PRs](https://github.com/platformatic/ssr-performance-showdown/pull/8) made React SSR x4 faster by enabling production mode, automatic JSX runtime, and upgrading to React 19 RC (Fast JSX).\n- 📜 [Never Call new Date() Inside Your Components](https://kyleshevlin.com/never-call-new-date-inside-your-components/): To keep your components testable you’d rather avoid initializing state with impure functions like `new Date()` or `Math.random()`, and pass it as props instead. IMHO you can also use React context.\n- 📜 [Consuming a Remix backend from a mobile app or external client](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-external-client): The `?_data` workaround will not work anymore under Remix Single Fetch mode. You’d rather create dedicated API routes for mobile apps and share common code in an abstraction.\n- 📜 [Why is CSS-in-JS slow?](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/why-is-css-in-js-slow): Greatly illustrated articles explain why traditional CSS-in-JS is slow, and how compiled CSS-in-JS makes it faster by avoiding a waterfall chain of steps for the browsers.\n- 📜 [Interface Segregation Principle in React](https://alexkondov.com/interface-segregation-principle-in-react/): Explains how to apply this SOLID principle when designing component props and encourages you to use composition.
