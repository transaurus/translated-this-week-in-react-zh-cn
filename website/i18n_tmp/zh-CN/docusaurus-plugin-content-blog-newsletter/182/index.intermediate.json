It should not contain any behavior change but will emit new warnings for deprecated features to help us upgrade to React 19. It should warn us when using string refs, defaultProps on FC/memo components, or when spreading a key prop (🐦 [preview](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1780519349247205589)).\n* 👀 [React Core - useDeferredValue’s `initialValue`](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/6747): In upcoming React 19 canary releases, this hook will take a new 2nd argument affecting the initial render. It will return the `initialValue` on initial render, and schedule a re-render in the background with the `value` returned.\n* 👀 [React Core - Automatically reset forms after action finishes](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28804): This new React 19 behavior only affects uncontrolled inputs, and aligns with the native platform behavior (it will now be the same with/without JS).
