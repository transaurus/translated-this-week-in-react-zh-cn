The readme describes it as an “experimental integration of React DOM and StyleX that aims to improve and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native.” It is based on the ideas from the [“React DOM for Native” RFC](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/496) and in my opinion could be huge for how we think about universal app development in the future. Today, the most common approach for universal apps for RN ist React Native Web, which shims RN components and APIs on the web. And while RNW is really great, it often feels like shoehorning one platform into another. The premise of react-strict-dom is that there is a single DOM library which universally supports web, iOS, and Android (and potentially more platforms in the future). The element API is based on web, which is why you see the very HTML-like syntax in the screenshot above.",

      "translated_content": "Meta本周不仅发布了React的重磅消息。今日GitHub上新出现的[react-strict-dom](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom)仓库，README将其描述为\"实验性的React DOM与StyleX集成方案，旨在改进和标准化面向Web与原生平台的React组件样式开发\"。其理念源自[\"React DOM for Native\" RFC](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/496)，可能彻底改变未来跨平台应用开发的范式。当前React Native Web（RNW）是实现跨平台的主流方案，它通过模拟RN组件和API在Web端运行。虽然RNW非常优秀，但常给人削足适履之感。react-strict-dom的核心在于提供统一的DOM库，同时支持Web、iOS和Android（未来可能扩展更多平台），其元素API基于Web标准，因此您在上图看到的语法与HTML高度相似。"
